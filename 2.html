											<h3 class="major">Colon Cancer</h3>
											<p>Most colorectal(Colorectal cancer is a cancer that starts in the colon or the rectum. These cancers can also be named colon cancer or rectal cancer, depending on where they start.) cancers begin as a growth on the inner lining of the colon or rectum called a polyp. Some types of polyps can change into cancer over the course of several years, but not all polyps become cancer. The chance of changing into a cancer depends on the kind of polyp. The 2 main types of polyps are: Adenomatous polyps and Hyperplastic polyps and inflammatory polyps. Citation: Article Title: "What is Colorectal Cancer". Website Title: American Cancer Society.

											<h3 class="major">Bladder Cancer</h3>
											<p>Bladder cancer begins when cells in the urinary bladder start to grow uncontrollably. As more cancer cells develop, they can form a tumor and spread to other areas of the body. Citations: "What is Bladder Cancer". Website Title: American Cancer Society. Simplfied URL: Cancer.org </p>

											<h3 class="major">Bone Cancer</h3>
											<p>A primary bone tumor starts in the bone itself. True (or primary) bone cancers are called sarcomas. Sarcomas are cancers that start in bone, muscle, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, fat tissue, as well as some other tissues. They can develop anywhere in the body. Citations: "What is Bone Cancer".

											<h3 class="major">Kidney Cancer</h3>
											<p>There are three main types of kidney cancer. Renal cell cancer is the most common type in adults and Wilms tumors are the most common in children. These types form in the tissues of the kidney that make urine. Transitional cell cancer forms in the renal pelvis and ureter in adults. Citations: " Kidney Cancer-Patient Version".

											<h3 class="major">Thyroid Cancer</h3>
											<p>Most thyroid cancers are differentiated cancers. In these cancers, the cells look a lot like normal thyroid tissue when seen under a microscope. These cancers develop from thyroid follicular cells.Citations: "What is Thyroid Cancer". Website Title: American Cancer Society. Simplfied URL: Cancer.org</p>

											<h3 class="major">Lymphoma</h3>
											<p>Different types of Hodgkin disease are classified by how they look under the microscope. This is important because types of Hodgkin disease may grow and spread differently and may be treated differently. The 2 main types are:

Classic Hodgkin disease (which has several subtypes)
Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease
All types of Hodgkin disease are malignant (cancerous) because as they grow they can invade and destroy normal tissue and spread to other tissues.Citations: "What is Hodgkin". Website Title: American Cancer Society. Simplfied URL: Cancer.org</p>
